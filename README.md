# Nexus Core AI | Mothership Protocol

This is the central neural hub for managing intelligent conversations and persistent neural databases across multiple AI providers.

## Access Tokens

To enter the Mothership, deploy one of the following neural tokens:

### Master Uplink (Owner)
- **Token:** `NEXUS-0000`
- **Privileges:** Full matrix control, invite generation, registry management. 
- **Registry Management:** Owners can generate new `NEXUS-XXXX` codes and revoke existing ones within the "Access Control" section of Matrix Settings.

### Standard Uplinks
- **NEXUS-0001**
- **NEXUS-0002**
- **NEXUS-0003**
- *Any code generated by an owner or following the pattern NEXUS-XXXX (0001-9999).*

## Configuration
- **Linguistics:** Supports English and Chinese.
- **Neural Database:** Enabled by default in Agent Mode to ensure persistent context.
- **Matrix Uplinks:** Connect your own **Google Gemini**, **Anthropic Claude**, **OpenAI GPT**, **xAI Grok**, or **DeepSeek** keys in the Matrix settings. 
- **Security:** All API keys are stored locally in the browser's encrypted-at-rest neural buffer (LocalStorage) and are never transmitted to our servers.

## System Notes
- Persistent memory is stored locally in your browser's neural buffer.
- Grounding via Google Search is available for up-to-date mission intelligence (Requires Gemini Pro).
